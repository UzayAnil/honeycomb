//NOTE: use zoom and in zoom webkit cursors when zooming, use move cursor for pan, need custom cursor for orbit

//TODO - orbit around where the cursor is at, not just orgin, orbit around center of mesh?
//make Z up


//on sketch prevent orbit, give not-allowed cursor, makers can change angles with look at tool
